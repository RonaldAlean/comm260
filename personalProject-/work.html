             <P>How did Spicy Pie Start.?</P>
             <p> We got our start many moons ago, as a small pizza joint in the heart of downtown Fargo, North Dakota. Over the years, we’ve been lucky enough to expand from Fargo throughout North Dakota, adding locations in Downtown Fargo, West Fargo, South Fargo, and Minot. And we’re extra excited for expansion plans throughout North Dakota, in the near future.

                The plan is simple at Spicy Pie: provide you with a great tasting pizza and excellent overall experience, by using of the best and freshest pizza ingredients. We want you to have a high-quality pizza, grinder, and other menu items every time you come to see us. The pizza dough you enjoy on each pizza-pie, is hand tossed to perfection. And the tostadas, tacos, or tortilla chips you order before or during each meal are made daily in the house. We don’t scrimp, either. We use a special cheese called Saputo cheese on our pizzas. And we use an outstanding tomatoes on our pizzas as well, called Alta Cucina tomatoes. These two items alone give you a unique experience that simply cannot be replicated on the midwest prairie.
